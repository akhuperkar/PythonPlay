    "** Q4. Write a program that reads a text document file and lists down the ten most used words and the ten least used words, along with their count. In the final list, if there is a tie, the clash should be sorted by dictionary preferences. Eg. Aroma will have preference over Brownie if both words occur the same number of times. Kindly use standard file input techniques. Words should at least have a length of 4. (35%) **"

    "**Read me:** I have written the *wordCounter()* function to achieve the required ask. The function takes path of the text document as argument. The document is read and text is split into lower case words using *lower()* and *split()* functions. The 'punctuation' package helps to get rid of all punctuation marks. The for loop iterates all words over the file and creates a set of unique words with minimum length of 4 characters. The loop also maintains a count of all unique words. Finally, 10 words are filtered from the list sorted in ascending and descending order of their counts. \n",
