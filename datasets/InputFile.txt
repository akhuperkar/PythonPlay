In AC analog circuits, a AC coupling AC capacitor AC is used to connect two AC circuits AC such that only
the AC signal AC from the first circuit AC can pass through AC AC AC to the AC next while DC is blocked.
This AC technique helps to isolate the DC bias settings of the two AC coupled circuits.
Capacitive coupling is also AC AC AC known as AC AC coupling and the capacitor used for the 
purpose AC is also known as a AC DC-blocking capacitor.
